# Soccer Birthdays

Watching the World Cup 2018. I spend some time writing a few things in Python. I wanted to predict soccer matches since The Simpsons failed me at predicting the final as Portugal vs Mexico.

I got a few datasets and ended up getting one from Kaggle. The dataset is from 2017 and has data for a few thousand players.

Initially I parsed the data and stored it in MongoDB. But it turned out to be really complicated. I ended up doing something much simpler.

I converted the CSV to a Python dictionary. Converted strings to dates. The program prints Birthdays for the current day.

It runs on the shell. Gordon Gekko style.
